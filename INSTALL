Preconditions 
=======================

Before compiling ABACUS 3.2 make sure that COIN-OSI is installed.
For more information on the installation of COIN-OSI see
https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi

We recommend to use OSI version 0.100. Please the the release notes
for more details.

To build the documentation several auxiliary programs are needed:

- cweave and ctangle for the tsp-example 
- doxygen and latex for the reference manual and user guide 
- tex4ht (actually the debian tex4ht package) for the html version
  of the user guide


Installation 
========================

Set the paths at the top of the Makefile to the include directories of
COIN-OSI and the LP solvers installed on your system.

Settings for different compilers are stored in the directory
Make-settings. Which settings file is used is determined by the variable
ABACUS_MAKE_SETTINGS. To compile ABACUS with g++-4.4, for example, do:

make abacus ABACUS_MAKE_SETTINGS=linux20-gcc44

To install abacus to a specific location instead of the base directory
set the variables ABACUS_INSTALL_LIBDIR and ABACUS_INSTALL_HEADERDIR in
the Makefile and run, for example:

make install ABACUS_MAKE_SETTINGS=linux20-gcc44

The environment variable ABACUS_DIR has to be set to the directory
containing the general configuration file '.abacus'. A master version
of this configuration file is provided in the base directory of the
ABACUS distribution. It is recommended that every user makes a private
copy of the file '.abacus' and sets ABACUS_DIR accordingly.

To set the environment variable to /home/yourhome, for example, using
the C-shell or its relatives, do: 

setenv ABACUS_DIR /home/yourhome

If the Bourne-shell is used do: 

export ABACUS_DIR=/home/yourhome

Usually it is convenient to add these instructions to the personal
'.login' file.
