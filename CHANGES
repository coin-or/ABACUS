Changes since ABACUS 3.0
=========================================================================

BUGFIX: Makefile was not compatible with MacOSX and newer OSI versions
BUGFIX: Added some missing #include directives
BUGFIX: Vol can no longer be chosen as the default solver
BUGFIX: ABA_MASTER::output() now produces output *before* (not after)
        the timing statistics (as specified in the documentation)
BUGFIX: Strong branching leads to abort (lp status could not be 
        determined) if iteration limit to low. 
BUGFIX: Branching on non-binary integer variables was flawed.
BUGFIX: OSIIF initialization tried to read objective value from linear 
        program that had not been solved.
BUGFIX: OSIIF::primalSimplex() and OSIIF::dualSimplex() did not use 
        the primal/dual simplex method, respectively, if newer
	versions of OSI were used. 
BUGFIX: Doxygen segfaulted due to LaTeX code in the html
        documentation.
BUGFIX: Fixed warnings 'deprecated conversion from string constant to 
        ‘char*’' 
BUGIFX: Do not complain in OSIIF if loading basis has failed
BUGFIX: only delete ws in OSIIF when defined
BUGFIX: Keep CPLEX license. Might cause memory leak if abacus is
	used recursively.
BUGFIX: several compatibility fixes for gcc >= 4.3
BUGFIX: lp solution information is now cached (compatibility fix for
        OSI >= 0.103).
BUGFIX: settings in abacus config file no longer overwrite settings
	from initializeParameters().

FEATURE: master can now provide the dual root bound
FEATURE: exception handling
FEATURE: compiler settings for gcc >= 4.1
