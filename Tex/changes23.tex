\section{New Features of ABACUS 2.3}
\label{section:new23}

\subsection{Version macro}

The include file {\tt abacusroot.h} contains now a define {\tt
ABACUS\_VERSION} with the version number of the \ABACUS\ release. It
is set to {\tt 230} in this release.

\subsection{New classes for separation}

New classes |ABA\_LPSOLUTION| for storing an LP solution and
|ABA\_SEPARATOR| for implementing a separation procedure 
facilitate encapsulation of the code. Moreover,
the class |ABA\_SEPARATOR| provides
functions for checking for duplication of generated constraints/variables.

% In a  forthcoming parallization of \ABACUS by use of this class,
% the separation can be executed on remote processors.


\subsection{Rank for constraints/variables}

A new virtual function |ABA\_CONVAR::rank()| allows to
associate a rank with a constraint/variable.
This rank can be used for ranking the  constraints/variables in the 
functions |ABA\_STANDARDPOOL::separate()|,
|ABA\_SUB::constraintPoolSeparation| and |ABA\_SUB::variablePoolSeparation()|.
