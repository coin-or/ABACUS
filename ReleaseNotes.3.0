ABACUS Version 3.0
********************************

Your help implementing new features 
or removing bugs is very appreciated.

There are several changes between the current version 3.0 and previous versions.

The three main-modifications we worked on are: 

************************************
* COIN-OSI (Open Solver Interface) *
************************************
We modified ABACUS to work with COIN-OSI. 
So there is no need to support any explicit Solver.
COIN-OSI has a broad reach of Solver, 
especial previous Solver used by ABACUS (Soplex,Cplex,Xpress) are supported.
List of all currently supported Solver:
 - Cbc	
 - Clp	
 - CPLEX	
 - DyLP	
 - FortMP	
 - GLPK	
 - MOSEK	
 - OSL	
 - SoPlex	
 - SYMPHONY
 - Vol	
 - XPRESS-MP

ABACUS can now be compiled with the GNU c++ compilers 3.3 - 4.1.


*************************************
* ABACUS Documentation with DOXYGEN *

We changed the documentation tool from CWEB to DOXYGEN.
It is now possible to build the reference manual in html format
and the complete user's guide in pdf and html format.
