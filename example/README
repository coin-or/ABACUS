The files in this directory implement a simple TSP-solver that shows
how an ABACUS application can be implemented. The purpose of this
program is not the fast solution of traveling salesman problem but
to show some features of ABACUS. Together with the ABACUS manual this
example should simplify the development of new ABACUS applications.

Installation
------------

- Modify the Makefile according to your environment. 
  There are comments in the Makefile with information how to set the variables.

- call "make" to obtain an executable program tsp
  (The CWEB tool ctangle must be installed)

- call "make tsp.ps" to obtain a Postscript Version of the program
  (In this case the CWEB tool cweave must be installed)


Solving Traveling Salesman Problems
-----------------------------------

  call "tsp <filename>"

  <filename> must be a problem instance in TSPLIB (see reference
  [Rei91] in tsp.ps.) format with edge weight type EUC_2D. If
  <filename> starts with "./" or "/" then the specified relative or
  absolute  filename is taken. Otherwise <filename> is appended  the
  value of the environment variable TSPLIB_DIR.


List of Problem Instances
-------------------------

You can obtain test instances for the example program of the
distribution from 
http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/iwr/comopt/soft/TSPLIB95/TSPLIB.html

Here are some problem instances taken from TSPLIB_DIR that have edge
weight type EUC_2D and that can be solved already with this program in
reasonable time. This solver is not designed for harder problem instances.
